### Features
### UI enhancements
- Added keypad/theme-color background loading screen that fades out after 600ms (or faster if Target BPM loads),
  to replace previous buggy code spread out all over the place to fade in various UI elements.
### Other
- Simplified CSP rules by removing need for inline CSS for Target BPM slide animation control.
- Extending `Storage.prototype` by using a `Symbol` instance instead of a regular property.
- Deprecated `location.hash` flags, using query string parameters to detect unreliable referrers + test feature flags,
  while using `history.replaceState` immediately to clean them off the URL for proper sharing.
  The deprecated flags will be supported through at least 2025-05-01.

- Migrated from `npm` to Yarn using PnP loose mode (no more `node_modules`!).
- Finally carried over the `Cache-Control` 1-year rule for static versioned assets into `_headers`.

- Added Cloudflare Web Analytics to track performance measurements.

## 5.0.3 (2022-09-08)
### Bug fixes
### Features
### UI enhancements
### Other
- Used `::before` placeholder elements more in order to reduce amount of color CSS variables (for future theme support).
- Defined `--color-surface-zXX` variables in terms of `z0` defaulting to a white overlay using single-color gradients,
  which further reduces the amount of color CSS variables while allowing overrides (transitions not supported).
- Removed the `-lg` color variant variables and applied the slightly darker accent color for contrast.
- Cleared out security headers for sub-resources in `_headers` (for performance).

## 5.0.0 (2022-06-25)

- Updated `node`, `eslint`, `stylelist`, and `esbuild` dependencies.
- Created type declarations for the game speedmod data.

- Added `.gitpod.yml` for use with Gitpod.
- Added a version suffix at runtime within the About box to show the current Cloudflare Pages staging deployment ID.

## 4.0.0 (2021-04-04)
### Bug fixes
- Fixed bugs that caused the app to fail to load when offline or on a slow connection.
- Fixed a bug where the menu is empty when reloading the app.
- Fixed an issue where some browsers would still trigger the keys when tapped even when disabled.
- Fixed a bug with the mouse when it leaves one key toward another while pressing.
- Fixed Target BPM mode results not using the correct multiplication sign.
- Fixed text overflowing off the screen on wide screens by reducing the font size on them.
### Features
- **Added a "One-handed mode" / compact keyboard inspired by PIU's Auto Velocity menu.**
  It can be activated manually from the menu (including to switch to left-handed mode), as well as automatically
  when the display height is short (such as small phones or split screen view).
- Added support for DDR A20 PLUS (same speed mods as A and A20).
- Added PWA launcher shortcuts for launching directly in SPEED MOD or TARGET BPM modes.
- Added preliminary support for keyboard shortcuts.
- Expanded unofficial browser support to Firefox 48 and older versions of Chrome.
- Expanded official browser support to include GNOME Web 3.34.1 on the PinePhone.
### UI enhancements
- Added support for display insets (aka the iPhone X and newer notch/curve design).
  The 0 key should no longer trigger when swiping up on the gesture bar.
  **If you had the app added to your home screen prior to this update, it must be removed and re-added.**
- **Added an underline for the currently focused display input to compensate for lack of contrast.**
- On supported browsers, vibration-based haptic feedback triggers when using the keypad.
- The game version selector side sheet can now be swiped away (on supported browsers such as iOS 13+).
- Loading Target BPM mode is now prioritized ahead of loading the menu.
- The Target BPM mode switcher is now always on-screen and never goes into the menu.
- Keypad keys will appear disabled until calculator code has actually activated.
- Enhanced the performance of the keypad color change when pressing a key.
- Added new simpler calculator "favicon" from Bootstrap Icons.
- Added improved font stack that loads Roboto Light on Android 4.x without loading Google Fonts.
- Added Cantarell and Ubuntu fonts to the font stack for better Linux phone support.
### Other
- Fix typo in CDN caching `s-maxage` header.
- Updated `.htaccess` to cancel out some new default headers set by production webhost that were causing caching issues.
- Explicitly added Firefox 68 and iOS 12.2 to `browserslist`.
- Updated listed browsers in the compatibility dialog to Android WebView 81 and Samsung Internet 11.1.
- Updated main keypad layout and most layouts to flexbox.
- Migrated the keypad and other UI elements to use `<button>` and other semantic and keyboard-focusable elements.
- Using `visibility: hidden` and animating it properly in order to exclude elements from keyboard focus when off screen.
- Added transparent outlines to button focus styles for use by Windows High Contrast Mode.
- Updated TWA detection code for Chrome 81+ changes.
- SVG loading is now handled and de-prioritized via `<svg><use>`, replacing the blocking `fetch()` calls.
- Replaced the `Feature-Policy` header with the new `Permissions-Policy`.
- Added the `<meta color-scheme>` and `<meta application-name>` tags.
- Added a "p" version suffix for browsers that don't support pointer events (used for the side sheet swipe so far).
- Added `lang` and `dir` fields to PWA manifest.
- Added npm script-based build process using `esbuild` to minify and version JS/CSS assets,
  with aggressive 1-year/immutable cache headers.
- Build step combines all SVGs into a single sheet.
- Moved from HTTP/2 Server Push to `<link rel=preload>`. Server Push had a lot of weird edge cases around caching and
  is on the way out on browsers like Chrome. Previously pushed assets are now preloaded, and module CSS is loaded at the
  same time as the JS (previously required a round-trip for the JS first to request the partner CSS).
- Generalized the about dialog CSS into re-usable classes, for future features that use a dialog.
- Used zero-width spaces on empty `<span>` tags to avoid flexbox shift issues in the display results area.
- Added `.nvmrc` with current Node LTS version.

## 3.3.0 (2020-02-23)

- Dark theme base background color is now Material Design's recommended `#121212`.
- Added maskable icon for adaptive icon support on Android 8.0/Chrome 78 and up.
- Moved back to status bar color matching keypad background in manifest, as Chrome 78 WebAPK kept status bar white in dark mode.
- The game settings side sheet can be navigated using a keyboard and the currently focused entry is highlighted.
- The "Target BPM On/Off" verbiage has been changed to "Switch to/from Target BPM".
- New dark background with centered icon splash screens for iOS that match the Android auto-generated one.

- New "Apply Update" button visible in About screen when an update has been installed, which allows activating it immediately.

### UI changes
- Added proper `favicon` (they pop up on mobile after all).

### Other
- Updated `README` with Remywiki shout-outs.
- Using standard `aria-disabled` and HTML5 `hidden` instead of custom classes to avoid losing accessibility score for e.g. disabled keypad buttons.

### Enhancements
- Eliminates flash of "0" when opening the calculator in Target BPM mode on subsequent visits.
- Slight color changes in display area to increase readability.

- **You can now select your preferred reading speed and then have the calculator show you the result of the nearest available speed mods based on the game you've selected. See `README` for more details.**

### Enhancements
- Provides OpenGraph/Facebook preview image metadata.
- Fixes Service Worker strategy to cache all assets for offline usage, otherwise every 2nd load (1st load of app update) requires an internet connection.

- Adds metadata tags for OpenGraph/Facebook.

- **You can now select which version of the game you're playing (and whether premium play is enabled) and invalid speedmod combinations are automatically blocked as you type.**
- Note: if you happened to have any browser extensions for DDR Calc (highly unlikely), the internal implementation details have changed, and it's very likely they broke.
